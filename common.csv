Restaurant,Beyond Flavours,Ppck2412,"Food is descent enough. Desert options were also good
Starrers were also tasty.
One bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time.",4
Restaurant,Beyond Flavours,Pragya Sarda,"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!",3
Restaurant,Beyond Flavours,Anindya,"Excellent food and very good service by soumen das..

Restaurant,Beyond Flavours,Santhosh Reddyy,My review for this place would be 5star for the ambeince and the service from the staff which lacks in lot's of place even though the food is good in places like these. Special hey to papiya shuvro!,5
Amazon,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,Jeffrey N. Fritz,"As good as the Echo is, the Echo Voice Remote seems to leave much to be desired. Whereas the Echo Dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently, the Voice Remote is far less likely to do so. Sometimes I'm not even heard at all. I often have to repeat commands several times before the Echo responds to me. Plus the volume control on the remote is slow to respond. And I don't mean a millisecond slow. The volume won't change for several seconds after the button is pushed.Yes, this is the New Generation Voice Remote.Aha! You say. You must be too far away from the Echo Dot.Granted, I am on the other side of the house when I use the Voice Remote. However, that doesn't explain why the shuffle button works immediately and correctly--every time. Plus doesn't Amazon brag on the device's great range If it was a distance problem, wouldn't the shuffle button have the same connectivity issue No, either I have a bad remote or the Voice Remote doesn't work as effectively and effortlessly as the Echo Dot itself. That's too bad.*** UPDATE ***I discovered that there is a trick to being understood when you use the Voice Remote, but it also comes with a gotcha. When you press down and hold the Talk Button on the Voice Remote, it's the equivalent of using the wake word on the Echo itself (Alexa, for example.) Since you can't see the LEDs on the Echo respond to the wake word, the Echo makes a tone to let you know that it's listening. There is a second a different acknowledgement tone after you release the Talk button. The Echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question.Read more",
Amazon,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,kemilie,"As other reviewers I wish that the remote still came with the handy magnetic base like the first ones did. It does, at least, come with the battery still. Because I know the remote will disappear to a never been seen again realm without a home I have decided to swallow my irritation it doesn't come with a dock and buy one to use with it. From my research it looks like this is the best bet - TotalMount Fire TV Remote Holder. The Fire TV remote appears to be the exact dimensions of the Echo remote, so I'm hopeful this will be a great solution even though it irks me to spend another 10 on a solution for something that used to be included! **Update: I ordered the TotalMount Fire TV Remote holder and it works great with Echo Remote.**We have a few Alexa units in the house and aside from the original one that came with a remote I haven't felt the need to buy another remote. Unless you blast your music it is normally fairly simple to engage with Alexa (at least how we have our rooms setup) even without the remote. However, my 3 and 4 year old have recently become quite the Alexa fanboys - checking the time, asking for jokes, listening to their playlists we've set up.... one of them can articulate clearly and Alexa responds, and the other can not. Before frustration got to a crazy level I decided a remote for the unit they normally talk to was the key.They (and I) love that you don't have to say Alexa *just* right to get a response with the remote. You simply hold down the microphone button and start talking (no wake word needed). Happy campers now. The range is great, the Alexa unit connected with this remote is in the middle of the house upstairs and no problems with using the remote anywhere upstairs (about 2000 square), as well as from two floors down in the crawl space - tested simply to see if it would work, and it did! We use Alexa on a daily basis and the remote is a great tool to go with it.",
Amazon,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,Jeffrey C Drywater,"The remote seems to function as the previous generation but the lack of a magnetic holster is a major disappointment. Having a place to park the remote was such a fantastic feature. At first, the Echo came with a remote (and holster). Then, I had to buy a remote separately with my second Echo, but it still came with the holster. Now, I have to buy the remotes for another Echo and a Dot and they don't have the holsters. Rather than raising the price or at least offering a choice, I feel like the quality is being stripped down with each new generation. I still like the Echoes okay, they fill a need, but I am worried about Amazon's choices in slowly cutting away the extras.",
Amazon,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,T. Masoner,"I got this great little remote and then spent half a day trying to get it to work properly. I was about to box it up and send it back because it only understood what I was saying about 10 of the time. I thought it was defective. Then I actually read the instructions that came in the box with it and you have to HOLD the button down while you speak. It's not a push then talk type affair like I expected. Once I got that figured out, it works great. Glad I bought it because I use it quite a bit from the bedroom. This will hold me over until my Dot is shipped. FYI, it doesn't come with the cradle any more, at least mine didn't.",
Amazon,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,Shain Mercer,Worked great for a few weeks then completely stopped working. Don't have the box now so can't return it.,
Amazon,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,cc,"So far, this is doing what I wanted it to. I purchased it for having Alex hear me from my bedroom and my dining room. At times when I am playing music louder or just wanting her to do a command, I have to repeat myself louder. I usually keep the remote in the bedroom to give her commands but I will move it when I have company and am sitting down to eat or with guests in living room. I can practically whisper the command using the remote whereas without it, I have to shout the command out to the other room. Also, did not find opening the back to insert batteries that difficult. Did take a few tries to pair it. I ended up replacing the batteries that were sent with Duracell",
Amazon,Alexa Voice Remote for Amazon Echo and Echo Dot,BFI66,Remote is a great addition......I Have two echo's and two dots which I use for my home automation. They work great. My only issue is that Amazon is no longer shipping the magnetic holder with the Echo. Felt this was a very helpful and welcomed addition which helped me organize my remotes safely. This is the only reason I am giving it 3 stars.....C'mon Amazon you are charging the same price as the older remotes labelling it new generation and eliminating the magnetic holder......disappointing,

Amazon,Amazon Fire TV,Mandy,"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",
Amazon,Amazon Fire TV,Gregory P. Baker,"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more",

Amazon,Amazon Fire TV,William Hardin,"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",

Amazon,Amazon Fire TV,Mandy,"I'm your typical middle-aged woman - I don't game, and I'm not super tech-savvy by any means....so take this review for what it is. The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!",

Amazon,Amazon Fire TV,William Hardin,"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",

Amazon,Kindle,L. Kirk,"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,Tricia L,"I have owned a Kindle for several years now. I have had the 2nd generation Kindle and I have had the Kindle Keyboard. When my mom expressed interest in getting a Kindle I decided to give her my Kindle Keyboard because she doesnt have Wifi in her house and my older Kindle Keyboard had 3G, which is what she needed. And I decided to buy the Basic Kindle for myself because (1) I didnt want to wait for the Paperwhite to come out and (2) I just needed Wifi and (3)and most importantly I JUST WANT TO READ A BOOK, not listen to text-to-speach, or go shopping on Amazon, or listen to music, etc. All I want to do is read a book...thats it! This Kindle is perfect for that. Its smaller and lighter, the pages turn faster than the Keyboard version, it basically has everything I need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the Paperwhite or Keyboard. Yes, you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindle with a 5-way controller, but I rarely use the keyboard anyway. To download a book, I just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my Kindle...which is much quicker no matter what version of Kindle you have. So if you dont need, want, or use all the extras then I would definitely recommend the Basic Kindle for 69 with special offers, because who really pays attention to the screen savers anyway.",
Amazon,Kindle,ShirtGuy,This is the third Kindle I have bought. I bought one for my Father and now this one is for my girlfriend. One little known feature of the Kindle is your get your own kindle.com email address when you buy one. You can use this email address to email books to yourself or to other people. I routinely download .mobi and .epub books online and email them to myself and to my Dad (and soon my girlfriend). Within seconds they will magically appear on your Kindle's home page.,
Amazon,Kindle,Carmylita,"I've had this a week now. I also have a Kindle Fire HD I have had for about a year, with the case on, the Fire HD is heavy. I love the HD, and never leave home with out it, but many times I wish I could just slip my books in my pocket and run. I go a lot of places on the run, take others places where I wait for them to shop or what ever, and there is not WiFi to play on my Fire HD. I just want to read. My reading time has come up from one book a year to 50 books a year, and now my reading will go up even more.This was the perfect answer. So feather light It is incredible. It is taking me a bit to not swipe the screen to turn a page, and get used to the lay out and use of the various buttons, but after an hour I had read the built in owners manual, learned the ins and outs of the buttons and had it set up. It connected to my WiFi instantly. The on screen key board has taken a bit to get used to but once you use it a few times you can do it pretty fast.I wondered how all my content, library of books would be transferred from my Fire HD, to this device. To my pleasant surprise after connecting to my Wi-Fi, the next time I looked at the home menu my entire library of over 300 books was there, archived. I just click a title and it down loads in seconds.I honestly can't tell the difference between the print on this and the print on my Fire HD. Pixel wise, my eyes can't differentiate a thing.I love the texture look of a page from a book look. The no glare is amazing. There are times and places I can't read or see the screen on my Fire HD, and this just runs circles around the reading in bright light. Yes!Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,Rustic,"I've had this Kindle for a while now. Many of the reviews say it all so I don't think I could add much. But I feel like I need to speak on behalf of this Kindle to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought. If this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it. So I have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us allDo you have any clue what you bought Let's all say it out loud: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE A LIGHT!!!!!! It is an entry level model with no light. Amazon has always sold non lighted Kindles, and I still have many of them. They are a cheap way to get into the e-reader scene. Can you read a real book in the dark Of course not. So these non lighted Kindles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light. It is ridiculous to buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because it doesn't have a light. Read the product descriptions. This Kindle has no light, the Paperwhite and Voyage do.Scream all to the heavens: THIS KINDLE DOES NOT HAVE PAGE TURNING BUTTONS!!!! To buy this Kindle then give it a 1 star review because your old Kindle had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane. Could you not see when you clicked on BUY that this Kindle had no page turning buttons. Sometimes I think there are two kinds of Kindle owners: those who want page turning buttons and those who don't mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page. If you can tell by my sarcasm, I belong to the latter bunch.Then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is, are unable to sign on, and blame it on the Kindle. BAM! another 1 star review.Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,MoonX,"As has been the case for years, Amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the Kindle. This one is no exception. If you've used a Kindle in the past, you're not going to notice much of a change with this one, but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth, I'll briefly go over them:*** SCREEN ***The new Kindle is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray/off-white paper looking background. It's certainly not bright white, but it's also not LCD looking (dark gray.) It does NOT have buttons for page-turning as the older generations do. If you simply must have the page-turning buttons, please search for the older Kindles that offer that. One last thing regarding the screen: this is not a Kindle PaperWhite or Voyage where you have a back-lit screen... this has an unlit, off-white Kindle screen. I will say, the text is noticeably crisper and bolder than I've seen with previous generation Kindles and I believe that's because Amazon is using E-Ink's new Carta displays instead of the previously used Pearl displays. I love that and have been waiting for years for E-Ink, the Taiwan based company that makes the Kindle screens for Amazon, to improve them. It looks like they're finally getting it!The new Kindle's screen resolution is 167 ppi which is slightly lower than the Kindle PaperWhite which is 212 ppi, and substantially lower than the Kindle Voyage which boasts an impressive 300 ppi (individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye.) Price-wise though, the base model PaperWhite runs 99 at the time of this review, and the Voyage base model runs 199 so you can see, the more you pay, the better the resolution and features. 167 ppi is fine though...Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,Michael Gallagher,"I am writing this from the perspective of being a long-time experienced Kindle user vs. someone brand new. From an overall perspective, considering the pricing of the Kindle with Special Offers at 79 vs. higher amounts for the different flavors of Kindle available today, this one is a bargain. If you have wanted to get your kids a Kindle to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because 119 to 400+ is a lot of money to risk with a child, maybe at 79 this is your price point.From a size standpoint, the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e-Ink Kindles. It is slightly thicker - but slightly lighter - than the Kindle Paperwhite, but to me it's not really a noticeable difference when you're holding it in a protective cover.Opening up the box, included with the Kindle is a micro-USB cord but no power adapter. That's really annoying. Interestingly, and it seems rather chicken of Amazon, a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for 15 if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the Kindle (or 20 if you purchase it later), so if you already have a micro-USB charger handy I wouldn't order one of the chargers.There are no page buttons - no buttons at all except for the power button - and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you're reading, or swiping the screen with your finger.Reading is easy on this one: in comparison to my Kindle Keyboard, the previous version of Kindle, and a Kindle DX the letters on the screen are much, much darker and easier to read: the display is crisp and dark.Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,Aaron,"I travel for work. More and more, I find myself leaving the Kindle Fire at home and traveling with just an e-ink Kindle. So when I broke my Kindle 3, I decided to replace it with this entry level Kindle (without special offers).What's good:* Smallest, lightest e-ink Kindle available.* Still has the page turn buttons!* Like all the e-ink Kindles, this thing has amazing battery life.What's just OK:* Only 2GB memory. More is better. Then again, after two years of buying books I'm nowhere near filling this thing up.* Text entry using the 5-way switch works, but that's about all. I'm surprised it works well enough that I can't consider it a negative.What's not so good:* The lighted cover costs nearly as much as the Kindle! Anyone thinking of picking up this Kindle and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight.The new Kindles look awesome. But they don't take anything away from this Kindle. It may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less. The Kindle is exactly what I need for traveling. It works wonderfully as a basic, no-frills e-reader. Reviewing it as such, I have to give it five stars.",

When I'm close to finishing a book, I plan ahead and download a new one (or two) so that I'm ready wherever I happen to be.Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,L. Kirk,"I got my first Kindle. This is a nice ebook reader. I'm going to jump right in and tell you what I found to be its Pros and Cons. Then I'm going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor, the Barnes Noble Nook Simple Touch.Kindle's Pros:Great Screen: Many people do not find LCDs hard to read on (e.g. smartphones, tablets, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc.), but virtually everyone will find E-Ink easier to read, any time of day. Especially the newest E-Ink Pearl displays. They simply look like paper and ink. I have never experienced any eye strain reading E-Ink book readers, but I have with LCD based phone/tablet screens.Thin and Lightweight: This Kindle is thinner than any paperback and lighter too. This makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position, and for long periods too. It also makes it easy to transport in a purse, backpack, or messenger bag (or in luggage for traveling). Many people like to take a few books when travelling, and this Kindle lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden.Good Value: Even without a touchscreen, the Kindle is a good value. It is a well-made product, it offers cloud storage of your books (and well it should, since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add-in microSD card), the screen is excellent, Amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing. The Kindle 4 is the best value of Amazon's E-Ink readers. Some may be tempted to get the version with the built-in light. If you can afford it, sure, go ahead. But let me point out you don't have to spend 20 for a fancy-schmancy book light. Your local dollar store has them for ... wait for it ... a buck.Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,M. Erb,"UPDATE: December 12, 2012: I had purchased the new Kindle Paperwhite thinking it would be a vast improvement over this Kindle. Well I had mixed opinions on it. You might want to read my review of the Paperwhite here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z0SDFOCZ66Z6/refcmcrrdppermBottom line is that the Kindle 6 E-ink Display is for the money an amazing product. Unless you really do a lot of reading in bed or in dark rooms, you don't need the Paperwhite at nearly twice the cost. I actually returned my Paperwhite due to all the screen issues. My review of the Paperwhite describes all you need to know.UPDATE: September 17, 2012: New firmware is available for the Kindle. It is version 4.1.0 as I write this. It brings some notable improvements to the Kindle experience...New features in this update include:-Improved reading font that is higher contrast and crisper so that you can enjoy a paper-like reading experience.-Parental Controls that allow you to restrict access to the Experimental Web Browser, Archived Items, and the Kindle Store.-Support for books with complex layouts and formats with Kindle Format 8.-Support for children's books with Kindle Text Pop-Up and comic books with Kindle Panel View (which allows you to read a comic book panel by panel). Books that support these features will be available in the Kindle store over the next few weeks.-Dictionaries grouped into a collection in Home and Archived Items called Dictionaries for better organization.Improved table and image viewing (panning and zooming) on supported titles.The update is available from the Kindle Support area on amazon web site.And now, back to my original review...Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,J. Ts,"First off, I received my new Kindle this morning. I previously owned the Kindle Keyboard, but actually really didn't like the keyboard or the way the buttons were pressed together. I'm not a fan of touch screens so I bought this one.There are a few things to know about this particular Kindle that can help you decide if it's right for you...Here is a list of things to know about this Kindle.1. You'll be using an onscreen keyboard with the 5-Way Controller. This is not a problem for setting up WiFi and a little writing but if you are an avid note-taker or do a lot of writing with your Kindle, you might want to opt for the Kindle Keyboard.2. NO AUDIO - If you are planning on listening to audiobooks, Mp3s, or Text to Speech on your Kindle, this is not the device for you. There is not even a headphone jack, so there is absolutely no audio support.3. 2GB! This device has 2GB of storage, which is half of all the others... if you seriously need to keep over 1,400 books or so on your Kindle, you should opt for one of the others, all of which have 4GB. I only keep a hundred or so books on mine and the rest are up in the Amazon Cloud waiting for convenient download.4. There's no 3G version but the WiFi works just fine.5. There is a shorter battery life. Amazon reports the battery life is only one month of reading, compared with the others that clock in at two months. If you are going to be away from electricity for over a month, first of all RESPECT!, second of all, you may want a Kindle that has the 2 month battery life.6. It's lighter than all the other versions. It weighs in at just under 6oz (170g). The closest competition is the Kindle Touch which is about 7.5oz.7. It has 5 buttons on the face at the bottom.Read more",
Amazon,Kindle,FreeSpirit,"Having been a little overwhelmed by the choices between all the new Kindles and which one to get, I ordered this new basic 79 Kindle first to take for a spin. So far, I like what I see. I also own a Kindle 3 so that's the only device I can really compare it to at this time (I think a comparison between other tablets and this Kindle is meaningless, this device is all about content and delivery):1. Form-factor - Compared to the Kindle 3, this Kindle feels more compact, lighter and easier to hold. My hands wrap around this better than K3. Reading books for a few hours at a stretch will be easier on this device compared to the K3. It is the lightest such device I have used compared to all previous Kindles and other tablets.2. Screen - I personally like the fact that there are no keys on the device and that keys come up on the screen when you need them. Delivers a better overall reading experience. However, navigating through the on-screen keyboard with the 5-way controller can be taxing if you need to do a lot of searching, and you might miss the full physical keyboard. I hardly search on the Kindle itself, I search for books on my laptop so this is a non-issue.3. Price! - At 79, you can't go wrong. Compared to buying paperback or hardcover editions, you will recover the cost of this in a matter of a few months because most Kindle content is priced cheaper than print editions (and you get it instantly, and can access it wherever you are). Not to mention all the free Kindle downloads available in the catalog.4. Display - almost the same E-ink display at the K3. No glare no reflection. You can sit in bright sunlight and read it just like a book. Page turns seem a lot faster on this compared to the K3.Read more",
Restaurant,Flechazo,Vivek Vuppala,We were 4 people who visited this place on Thursday night....Ambience and service are good .Food is disappointed.Not worth for money we pay.,
Restaurant,Flechazo,Jalaj Goyal,"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!

Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.

Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

Ambience: 3.5/5

Restaurant,Flechazo,Gayathri Ravinder,"Wide spread buffet, taste is good too, courteous staff very polite. We had a family dinner there and all of us had a lovely time especially kids love the live counters.",
Restaurant,Flechazo,Fairina Siddiqui,"I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.
But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place.",
Restaurant,Flechazo,Rahul Kolli,"The starters were good . Especially mutton starter , They are many varieties in Chicken then other items .
The ambience is so good and the staff is great .
Jayanta service was very good and food was on time. Thanks to them .",
Restaurant,Flechazo,Sneha Battula,"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.

Food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.

Starters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.
Main course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. Leave some space for the pasta though.
Dessert: This section gives a whole new meaning to the term ""spoilt for choice"".

This place is indeed a foodie's delight.",
Restaurant,Flechazo,Meghna Basavaraj,"Visited on 12 may 2019, for lunch with family. Awesome food, comfortable seating, soothing ambience. Booked table through Zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes!!

Went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.

Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.

Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..

I was surprised with a Mother's Day cake, complements of the restaurant.. that was a wow gesture.. a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food!!",

Restaurant,Flechazo,Ananya G,"I went to this place for lunch buffet by seeing the high ratings in zomato.

Good things first, the service is excellent! The waiters literally takes care of you when you are there.

Food: nothing great. As am more of a ""starter"" person , I love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse it's not served the way you like it. The sushi and Pani Puri were very okay-ish type
Main course was very normal, nothing extra ordinary. Taste of the food was very normal.
In dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good.

Service: it's very good and all the servers are trained very well.

Ambience: The place was jammed packed even for a Tuesday lunch. Couldn't enjoy that much as there was rush in front of every counter.

All in all a very okay-ish lunch!",

Don't be fooled by word unlimited beverages. only a single type of beverage is unlimited and you can't choose the flavour.

Restaurant,Flechazo,Vidhatri Reddy,An decent buffet ranging from your own customised pizza to the amazing starters. The place was crowdy even on a week day. Servers and chefs taking personalised comments on food delivered was very satisfying. But the finger food on conveyor belt was cold. The pizza needs flavour and tom yum soup is real disappointment. Couldn‚Äôt get to main course but the spread seemed interesting. Would love to visit again.,

Cons:

2.no hard drinks available

Overall a very nice experience, go and enjoy!!!",
Restaurant,Flechazo,Rajsi Gaikwad,"I absolutely loved this place. Let me begin how comfortable this place is. The sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy. We were served with welcome drinks. Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.
The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.
Overall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues.",
Restaurant,Flechazo,Kiran Kumar Lc,Loved the food here especially baby potato in harissa and sweet chilli barbeque prawn is must try in starters and smoked paan ice is just wow.

Mutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mention.

Restaurant,Flechazo,Rupayan Banerjee,It is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. My friend and I had come with great expectations. But the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience. However to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.,
Restaurant,Flechazo,Surya Prathipati,"I visited Flechazo today with my family. The ambiance is very pleasant. The service provided by Ranjit and Ramjan was excellent.

What makes Flechazo is their friendliness and service. Celebrated my son‚Äôs and wife‚Äôs birthdays here, was so much fun with friends.

Special thanks to their team, Jayanta, Hasibul and many for making this such a pleasant experience.

Love coming to this place again and again and again !",
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,Sandy,I read all of the reviews of If you have the Fire HDX 8.9 don't buy this 10.1 tablet. The resolution is just as good on the 10.1 as the HDX. Starts up faster that the HDX. It's a nice size not a solid square like the IPAD'S. I saved myself 80.00 by buy the refurbished there is nothing wrong with it. I highly recommend this Kindle over than a high priced IPAD.,
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,donna,"I've had 4 kindles and have loved each until now. I tried to save a few bucks by purchasing a refurbished fire 10. I'm so disappointed in its performance. It's slow loading , it freezes up and I have to constantly restart it. Battery life is terrible.",
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,Amazon Customer,This review is about the certified refurbished Fire HD 10 unit I ordered. It looked and acted like a new unit for 80 less. Still trying to decide if I want to give them back 15 to remove the obnoxious adds on the lock screen. They really aren't that bad.,
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,GMA,"I purposely waited almost 4 months before leaving a review. I wanted to see if any issues developed before leaving feedback. I was not disappointed. The refurbished fire arrived in perfect condition, no scratches or wear. I purchased a screen cover immediately to insure it would remain in good shape. After 4 months, it works like a champ. No issues whatsoever. VERY PLEASED and would not hesitate purchasing refurbished item again. Amazon has ALWAYS treated me superbly with any issues I might have with orders or returns.",
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,Sara B,I've owned several different tablets. This one is by far the slowest. And I don't mean it's a little slower. I mean you have to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen. Opening apps can be quick or take up to 3 minutes. I've had far more issues with this Fire than any of the others we've owned. If I had realized the difference in speed I would have kept my old one. It's definitely not work the larger screen. It's a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be. But even on it's fastest day it's significantly slower than the others.,
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,Giacomo,"I've had the Kindle Fire HDX 7 inch tablet for almost 3 years and when I compare it to the Fire HD 10, the earlier tablet comes out the big winner. I find the larger tablet considerably slower. Several apps load quite slowly. The battery is consumed much more quickly. Maybe this is not comparing apples with apples, but I had expected at least the same speed.",
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,gamecrazy,Have had this probably 3 weeks. Wanted to be fair with my review. The battery in my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it. Tried the Fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. Returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the Fire 10. Amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. The Fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. The apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. In the first three days it froze up 4 times. I wondered if it was doing this because I had too many apps opened. Once I started closing the apps I wasn't using I haven't had the tablet freeze problem. I do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. I also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by Amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary. Why Amazon stopped the 8.9 is beyond me but I'm doing ok now with the 10. If you get it give it some time.,
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Fire HD 10 Tablet,G Fontaine,"I've had my hdx 7 going on 3 years, I love it! I needed a larger screen for my eyes, I'm so glad I went with the refurbished, I've only had to get used to the different op system. I don't use this for gaming or movies, I am an avid reader and this is awesome for increasing the size of the pages and font. I did have some problems downloading my books but that's just me and my lack of kindle tech it shouldn't take me too much longer to get used to this newer system.",
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,Dixie Bee,"I have now owned 4 Kindles and just love them! My first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse. I had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank. I then got 2 Kindle Fires. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other. I have had no problem with the Fire once I broke down and read some of the direction, if all else fails. Other than operator error I have used it for over a year but it's too heavy for my old overused hands. Not heavy though. Books now give me problems. Even paperbacks. But I then bought the smaller, lighter new Kindle and loved it from the first. I carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months. I called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one. This time I bought a light weight cover for it. I don't like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it I have to protect it. I have had this one for months and have had no problems. I now have about 600 books awaiting my pleasure! I just looked the Kindles over again. I'm getting paranoid about my little Kindle and am considering having an on site backup although Amazon would get me one here in just a couple of days. Still giving it thought. Basically I love my Kindles and use both of my current ones for different apps.",
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,Alex Johnson,Very useful for those who enjoy reading and inspiring those who do not have a habit of reading. Needed for anyone not yet,
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,Beaches,I have the kindle fire but was frustrated when taking it to the beach. This model is easy to read on the beach and was easy to set up. You can't tell that it's refurbished - it looks brand new.,
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,Amazon Customer,Excelente,
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,James H Mann,"DON'T BUY a reburbished Kindle. I've had to return them, twice. Apparently, Amazon's definition of refurbish is to take a Kindle with some problem or defect, simply repackage it and send out again to see if some different customer might take it off their hands.Both times, the 'refurbished' Kindles shorted out in different ways. The Kindles especially liked to misfunction while I was in the middle of working out at the gym.",
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,Shannon S.,"The refurbished Kindle looks brand new, I wouldn't even know that it was used. The only down side was that when I opened up the package, the Kindle was already on.",
Amazon,Certified Refurbished Kindle E-reader - Black,Daniel Altenburg,"Bought a refurbished kindle and literally after one month of owning it the device started to freeze. I had to reboot it multiple times and then it would start working. Went on a trip and it worked as it should but as soon as I returned the battery died and I charged it over night and the next morning the screen was frozen with the character reading a book under a tree. I tried all rebooting methods (20 seconds, 40 seconds, 1 minute) and nothing. Called customer service and was on the phone for an hour. Eventually they said that they could only give me 35 off the next purchase of a new kindle. I was pretty bummed out that a refurbished product of their own was not backed by them. I ended up buying a new kindle with the discount they gave me but should have just went with a new one to begin with since I ended up spending the same amount of money and had way more of a headache to deal with. Now I have to figure out what to do with this new Kindle Paper Weight that I have.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  I had have one of the best experiences with Air Astana because my April trip from Dubai to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty and Astana and back included 6 flights and all  were in time. Different types of aircrafts, such as B767 from DXB to ALA, Airbus 321 long range from ALA to NQZ Astana and Embraer E2 to UKK, all were clean and their condition was also good. Of course in this challenge A321Long range definitely wins because it was brand new. As for food everything was nice and wide choice of beverages is still available as before pandemic. And one more thing I took part in air Astana stop over holidays program for international travellers and my hosting in Almaty and Astana in hotels was very friendly. On international flights airline gives complimentary amenity kit even in economy class. I just have to mention that my screen of entertainment system on my way from Dubai to Almaty didn't work. That's why I took one point from my overall mark.",
Airline,Air Astana,, I fly this airline weekly for Almaty-Baku-Almaty and I have never ever had the flight on time. 40-60 minutes delay is routine for Air Astana. They have to reassess their attitude and schedule because those repetitive delays are not acceptable for what they call 4-star airline. The airline prices are not on level of service they provide either - Disappointing service to be honest.,
Airline,Air Astana,," This is really a different airline. The plane was impeccable, clean, looked young. Cabin staff is really amazing, taking care and checking during the hole flight. Food was exquisite. The Samsonite amenity kit was amazing, sleek and modern. A real pleasure to travel on this airline.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  I booked with Air Astana for a flight from Tashkent to Astana transiting in Almaty. Our flight was delayed for over an hour in Astana - an additional one hour later than my original booking. This meant that I now have too short a transit time and need to be re-scheduled. I received an SMS advising that I am rescheduled for a morning flight (arrival 10 a.m. the next day instead of 6 pm) I then went into frantic messages to my hotel in Astana cancelling my booking - about AUD100 extra for a few hours! On check-in I was moved to another later flight with no discussion with me. So I am unaware of this, land in Almaty transit and go to the counter to check my hotel voucher. There, I am directed to the amended boarding pass and it is for a night flight arriving 10pm. So, again, frantic messages to my hotel - after over 20 minutes running around to get a Kazakh SIM card - to re-book my room. I found the place now fully booked. Called them and thankfully, they re-booked my room. ",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  The flight that I report was supposed to take place in March 2022, but it never took place. It was cancelled. However, a year after the flight, I haven't got any repayment although I've sent all the necessary documents to the company. All I got was promises. I did try to believe the company and even traveled with Air Astana once again in October 2022. Still, no keeping promises. ",
Airline,Air Astana,, What a nice little airline! Air Astana provides economy passengers with a surprisingly generous amenity bag which was a nice touch. Cutlery was real metal (rare in economy!) The food was really good and the staff were friendly. This is how an airline should be run! Well done guys.,
Airline,Air Astana,,"  It was an amazing experience on all the 4 flights with Air Astana (IST-ALA-DEL and DEL-ALA-IST). Seats were very comfortable with enough leg space. Food was fresh, delicious and filling with lots of options (if you book pre-meal). Airline staff was exceptionally helpful and caring, they were just a bell away. Definitely value for the money.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Everything was perfect, but not in Atyrau or in Almaty, no ground service available for business class. No lounge, no private vehicle or at least priority check in. There was a line in Atyrau in business class check in but only one agent was available and service was not welcoming at all. I suggest to provide an access to VIP lounge if you don‚Äôt have own lounges in Atyrau and Almaty airports, and add it to the ticket price. In flight service was exceptional. ",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  My flight from Aktobe to Almaty was canceled. I had another flight to Phuket and then from Phuket to Sydney by another airline. Air Astana didn‚Äôt provide any option to get to Almaty, they only offered to return money or re-book to 3 weeks later. Call center couldn‚Äôt help. I bought by my own ticket to Almaty through Nur-Sultan and requested refund for this segment and compensation of my expenses for ticket I purchased by myself. I haven‚Äôt received yet any answer from them from July, 5, 2022.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  I experienced exceptional customer service from the ground staff who checked in our baggage was professional and exceptional customer orientated. Not only she helped with our special request (which she could easily deny as per rules and which required an extra effort from her side) moreover, she went beyond that. She send an email to the Air Astana representative in Georgia asking for assistance, which we never asked for.  She even accepted a slight extra bag weight and wished us a pleasant flight. Airbus 320 Neo - nice aircraft with comfy chairs. Good selection of movies, would be cool to have some podcasts though! Overall flight was good, rest of the staff did well also.",
Airline,Air Astana,," Thoroughly enjoyed flight from Nur Sultan (Astana) to Frankfurt with Air Astana Sunday 14th Feb 2021, I was travelling from Almaty to Frankfurt via Astana. First leg economy, second leg business. The service on both flights was very good and the food and drink outstanding. Tasty sandwich on the first domestic leg and given plenty of choice and excellent presentation of starter and main course on the international flight. Good Job Air Astana.",
Airline,Air Astana,," I have been using Air Astana on various domestic and international routes for 15 years. I have seen great improvements in this time from the early days. Not only in the quality of the aircraft and facilities but especially in in the cabin services. My recent flight this month highlighted this. Though I travelled economy I found the cabin staff very attentive and helpful. They were polite and supportive and prompt with any requests. The food was excellent, it was breakfast but hot, tasty and filling. The amenities packs are now eco friendly. They contain all those items that one requires on a journey of 3 hours or longer. They look good too. It was a new aircraft that was very clean, with comfy seats and was equipped with an excellent entertainment package. My only concern was travelling during these difficult times and the flight was full, understandably with the reduce number of flights scheduled. The in cabin safety brief, which is excellent and worth watching in all three languages, has had an amendment to relate to the latest pandemic requirements. The cabin crew enforced these rules without fear or favour in a very polite and professional manner. Keep up the good work Air Astana, you are my favourite airline.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Poor service with customers. I booked 2 tickets in February and March. The company canceled the flights and sent emails automatically. No clear information or explanation. I tried many times to contact the call-center of the air company to get more information about the flight and discuss the schedule, but no answer. I sent an email immediately but replied after 2 months without detailed information. I have been waiting for a refund for 3 months. This is my first time to face such as poor service and no respect for customers.",
Airline,Air Astana,," Almaty - Saint-Petersburg is my favourite route. Flight was on time. Aircraft was brand new A320NEO (2 months old). Service was excellent, food was very good, choice of beverages perfect. Now airline using eco packs for amenity kits and it looks so good! And also inside of the kit they even put neck pillow, because flight was longer than 5 hours.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  London Heathrow - Nur Sultan - Almaty in December 2019, returning 8 days later. Check in at LHR was efficient and fast track through security excellent. However the flight was then delayed at the last minute and there was hardly any seating at the gate where we had to wait, no announcements/updates and few staff who seemed a little disorganised and unhelpful. Several passengers including myself had connecting flights which was making people quite agitated as they were unsure what would happen if they missed their connections. Once aboard, the cabin layout and space were excellent. Staff were efficient, polite and you were made to feel very welcome. The food choices were great, very tasty and portion sizes just right. There was a huge choice of drink options too. The seat converted easily to a very low level lay flat bed and I managed to sleep for a few hours. Upon arrival in Nur Sultan I was met off the flight (pre-arranged) and taken through security with a quick stop in the lounge to freshen up before joining my connecting flight on to Almaty. The lady who met me was excellent and couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. It was a huge help to me as I was travelling alone and there was very limited time to pass from international to domestic and then find my onward flight to Almaty. She spoke perfect English and made the transfer very smooth for me. The flight to ALA was good. Plenty of leg room and great adjustments on the seat, especially for leg support, but perhaps more tricky to climb out of from a window seat than the previous flight layout. The breakfast menu was excellent as you could choose anything from a pastry and coffee right up to a full cooked breakfast. The cabin crew served this efficiently in a limited time frame. My return journey was equally enjoyable. On the Nur Sultan to LHR leg there were about 40% seats not occupied in business class which made the experience even more special as the staff had more time to ensure you were comfortable. It was nice to be able to enjoy this leg during daylight hours as I‚Äôd slept a chunk of the outward version of this leg! All in all I really enjoyed my first experience with Air Astana. The only disappointment was the initial delays at Heathrow, the area we had to wait and how these were handled by the ground staff there.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  I want to say thank you to the Nomad Club team. Recently I had a trip from Almaty to Dubai, this trip was quite difficult, we went through all sorts of delays to weather and other reasons, flight changes, etc. Once this trip was over I described everything to Air Astana Customer care, and I was very satisfied with their response and actions. ",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Almaty to Bishkek. Have flown this route number of times in past year sometimes via TSE, the older version of Embraer used which in my view is more comfortable than the new model in their fleet. All Sectors on schedule, very pleasant crew.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Atyrau to Almaty. Cabin crew was inattentive and rude. Twice requested for a blanket, didn‚Äôt get it till the end. That time I thought maybe it‚Äôs not included for economy seats. But last time had to take business class ticket, yet no blanket was given and service was still not the welcoming. Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Food quality was satisfying. Also my friend‚Äôs luggage was lost on his flight. Asked me to help him to negotiate with lost and found team since he doesn‚Äôt speak Russian. The operator was non-helping. When i asked her the approximate time his luggage will be delivered she told me that it will be there after one hour. We waited 3 hours at hotel lobby at night, and didn‚Äôt get it. The lost and found was already out of service. I guess company like this can afford to make the lost and found service 24/7. So the luggage was delivered only at noon, even though airplane that brought it from Amsterdam arrived at night. ",
Airline,Air Astana,,  London to Nur-Sultan in August 2019. Awful experience. They used to be good but not anymore. I often fly from London to Almaty using Air Astana. The check in company ASC at Heathrow Terminal 4 used by Air Astana are rude and not friendly at all. ,
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Tashkent to London via Almaty / Astana.  Air Astana customer service is horrendous, especially if you‚Äôre stranded at an airport trying to get home. On my 7-hour flight, there was no inflight entertainment or USB charging points. I‚Äôm on the verge of tears midway through a journey from Tashkent to London via Almaty and Astana. My flight from Astana to London has been delayed, which happens. It‚Äôs not the first time and won‚Äôt be the last. Air Astana‚Äôs handling of the delay has bee utterly abysmal and frankly negligent. I was at the airport 1.5 hours before my flight was due to leave as I was transferring from Almaty. I had no notification or text message, I just found out when I wanted to make my way to the gate! I tried to find some staff, no one was around to ask questions. I went to the business lounge, who rang someone and said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre coming‚Äù. A whole 40 mins later, no one came. I went to one of the gates to ask staff there. They asked if I was on the Dubai flight. When I said no, they walked off. At this point I didn‚Äôt know whether my flight was cancelled, delayed or what time it was due to London. I eventually found a desk in the corner of the terminal and they advised me to go upstairs to get some food and water. They had no vegetarian options at all and tiny cups of water. I‚Äôve been travelling for 20 hours at this point and still don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm going to get home ... but at least I have a drop of water to keep me going.. Do yourself a favour and book any other airline.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Novosibirsk to Almaty via Nur Sultan. Check in was easy and straight forward. There were no problems with being 1kg overweight. Both flights left and landed on time. Cabin crew were polite and spoke good English and managed to serve a snack on each flight, despite them being short flights. Seats were comfortable. I had paid extra for the Nur Sultan - Almaty leg and quite spacious.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Kuala Lumpur to Almaty. I credit Air Astana for their superior service on a recent flight from KUL to ALA last Tuesday 1st October. The service received on the flight was second to none, where the team leader provided a first class service during the the 7 hour flight. The quality of the main meal, wine and snack was excellent. I know Air Astana has received some criticism in the past but it was one of the best experiences I have had when flying. They made you feel welcome and special from start to finish.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Beijing to Almaty. Airline billed me R1800 for my hand luggage bag, while was within its weight limit. According to their statement hand luggage and a laptop bag is 2 items, hence the reason I needed to check in my hand luggage, knowing only on bag is allowed. They than ask me to pay via my debit card. We were a team and I was asked to pay, my team was allowed to take hand luggage and a laptop bag. I demand my money to be refunded.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Moscow to Shymkent via Almaty. For foreign passengers buying Air Astana's tickets through travel websites such as Expedia or Priceline, beware of tactics in getting people to buy their low priced tickets, only to find out the 'Economy Class with one piece of checked luggage included' actually means only 1 kg of checked luggage, which is less than the weight of most suitcases! On their website, the baggage policy for Economy class is stated as 20 kilos, with no mention of a 1 kilo policy. We flew from Moscow to Shymkent and even though our confirmation page clearly stated we are economy passengers with 1 piece of luggage included, we were forced to pay for excess luggage because their system showed we are not allowed checked luggage. We complained to the supervisor in charge of Air Astana check in desk at Moscow SVO airport but she was rude and unhelpful. She was basically saying 'I don't care what your Confirmation Page says. We go by our system so either pay or don't fly!' We have since complained to Air Astana and asked for a refund, but no reply yet. Beware!",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Kuala Lumpur to Almaty. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the crew of KC936 at the 25th August for their good work in conditions of prolonged turbulence. The stewardesses, in spite of the shaking, carried out the service, organize food and drinks. The food was excellent. Service was on top! Thanks to the pilots and the entire crew for the excellent flight.",
Airline,Air Astana,," Astana to Delhi via Almaty with Air Astana. Horrible experience, airlines delayed the flight but gave no updates or indications when the flight would go. They changed the pre blocked seats, shifted me from aisle to window, this is despite having a boarding card for aisle seat. When I complained to cabin crew, they were arrogant and told me you did not pay to block so we can move you if we want. They were not at all apologetic for the delay, on top of that they did not serve a proper meal saying that I had not made a special request, which is strange as I had not made a special request while coming into to Almaty as well, but the they served the meal. The passenger in the seat in front also had an issue and the stewardess was like you can write if you want it doesn‚Äôt matter.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Our flight from Baku to Nur-Sultan was supposed to depart at 11.50pm on 23 June 2019. However, due to mechanical problems, the flight got cancelled and we were rebooked on the flight at 11.50pm on 24 June 2019. Therefore, we were delayed to depart Baku for 24 full hours. The Air Astana ground staff in Baku Airport made absolutely no formal announcement in English about the process. So we did not know what to do and what to expect. Many passengers just formed a circle around the ground staff and it was a total chaos. The whole process took almost 5 hours from flight cancellation until we got our bags and left the airport. All passengers were very exhausted and we were not provided any food or drink during that time. We were provided food or drink for the first time around 6 hours after flight cancellation. It seems to me that Air Astana could not professionally handle flight delay/cancellation situations. I also requested Air Astana to provide us delay compensation according to the ""Air Astana Rules on Long Delay Cancellation and Denied Boarding"" policies on 28 June 2019. I have not heard from Air Astana since then.",
Airline,Air Astana,,"  Almaty to Moscow. Every time I used Air Astana I was always satisfied by the service provided and attention to every detail. Aircrafts are ideally clean, quality of food is good, personnel are professional and attentive. But this flight positively surprised me. New aircraft, updated stylish kits for passengers and especially children, comfortable chairs. I felt myself, like I was in business class! In general, compared with other airlines, Air Astana differs by its client orientation in every element of service: dessert choice, music, responding to requests, desire to do all that is possible to solve client issues, cleanness inside aircrafts - which is very important (blankets, toilets, etc). ",
Airline,Air Astana,," Almaty to Dushanbe with Air Astana. Forced me off my flight during check in (plane was not cancelled, it was overbooked) even though I booked 3 months in advance. Staff said this happens everyday and could provide no help. They suggested I contact their office who has not responded to my questions. Staff even asked me to please complain because this happens so often and they are clearly sick of it. To avoid this problem for others, I would recommend not using this airline as they were extremely unprofessional and no one could answer my questions. I travel every month to many countries across Asia and have never been treated so poorly. Later, Air Astana replied to my compliant with A) Wrong flight/date, and B) blamed it on a travel agent (I didn't use a travel agent) and C) stated an email notification was sent when it was not. The fact that they will lie to invalidate my legitimate complaints shows the type of business they do.",
